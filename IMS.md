IMS (Information Management System) is a hierarchical database management system by IBM, meaning that it organizes data with a tree structure. 
Its website is https://www.ibm.com/products/ims-database-management-system. 
It is a commercial database system, so users need a license to utilize it.
IMS uses different types of hosting models. One of them is the mainframe-based system in which data is deployed on mainframe computers and hardware. 
Both Java and Python access IMS with standard interface IMS Connect middleware. Specifically, Python can access it using a package called "ibm_db", 
provided by IBM for Python to connect with IMS.
