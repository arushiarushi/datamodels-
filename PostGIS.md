PostGIS is a spatial database. This means that it is designed for storing and manipulating spatial data. Spatial data includes geographic/locational data, 
which is what makes spatial databases different from other databases because of the specialized functionality and specific usage of it, such as for
spatial data analysis and geographic information systems. 
PostGIS is open-source. PostGIS uses a client-server hosting model. PostGIS is installed on a  server and clients (like applications) can connect to PostGIS over a network 
using the PostgreSQL protocol. 
For Java, the way to access PostGIS is through JDBC. Some JDBC drivers that can be used with PostGIS are PostGIS JDBC driver and the GeoTools JDBC driver.
