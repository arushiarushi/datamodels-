Oracle is a relational database management system. It's website is: https://www.oracle.com/, where one can download Oracle. Oracle operates commercially, which means that it requires a fee for a user to use. Oracle's hosting model is client-server because the client can access the database information and the server handles the Oracle software. Java's common way of accessing Oracle is using an API called JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) which allows Java to interact with relational databases.
