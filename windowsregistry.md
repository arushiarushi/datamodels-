Windows Registry is a hierarchical database; it is organized in a tree like structure. Specifically, it stores information to configure the system for users
and applications. It's website is https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-overview. 
It's not open source because it is part of the Windows operating system. This means that this database is embedded into the Windows operating system. 
In Java, the java.util.prefs package is one API that lets Java acceess the Registry.
